WELCOME TO GOLDBERG

Goldberg is a Rails generator.  The "goldberg" directory here needs to
be installed in a place where Rails looks for generators.  On
UNIX/Linux systems you can put it here:

    ~/.rails/generators 

Windows users can put it here:

    %USERPROFILE%\.rails\generators

(i.e. C:\Documents and Settings\<userid>\.rails\generators)


The Goldberg website contains more information on installing and using
