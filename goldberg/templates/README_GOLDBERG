WELCOME TO GOLDBERG!

All the files for your site should now be in place.  The following
steps are required to complete your setup:

1. Set up your database.  This distribution includes starter databases
   with minimal configurations for either MySQL 5 or PostgreSQL.
   These database files have already been unpacked to the /db
   directory here.  The Goldberg website <http://goldberg.240gl.org>
   provides more information on setting these up on specific
   platforms.

2. Edit your config/databases.yml in accordance with the above.

3. Delete the file public/index.html that was automatically generated
   by Rails.  You won't need it.

There may be extra steps required to get Rails working, especially if
you are using shared hosting and/or FastCGI.  Check your provider's
Rails documentation.

Good luck using Goldberg!
