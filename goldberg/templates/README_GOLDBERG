WELCOME TO GOLDBERG!

All the files for your site should now be in place.  The following
steps are required to complete your setup:

1. Create your database and edit config/database.yml accordingly.

2. Execute the following commands to set up your database:

    rake migrate
    rake goldberg:load_starter

3. Delete the file public/index.html that was automatically generated
   by Rails.  You won't need it.

There may be extra steps required to get Rails working, especially if
you are using shared hosting and/or FastCGI.  Check your provider's
Rails documentation.

Good luck using Goldberg!
