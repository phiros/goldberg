WELCOME TO GOLDBERG!

All the files for your site should now be in place.  The following
steps are required to complete your setup:

1. Set up your database using the following commands (replace
   {hostname}, {username} and {dbname} with appropriate values): 

    $ mysql -h {hostname} -u {username} -p -e "create database {dbname};"
    $ mysql -h {hostname} -u {username} -p {dbname} < db/goldberg_db_mysql.sql

2. Edit your config/databases.yml in accordance with the above.

3. Delete the file public/index.html that was automatically generated
   by Rails.  You won't need it.

There may be extra steps required to get Rails working, especially if
you are using shared hosting and/or FastCGI.  Check your provider's
Rails documentation.

Good luck using Goldberg!
