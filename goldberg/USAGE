GOLDBERG

Goldberg is a generator that provides you with the files required to
set up a fully functional Rails web site.  The files include:

* Controller, model and view code and templates.

* A backup of a minimally-configured Goldberg database.

* A custom routing file.

Goldberg is designed to provide the framework around the web
application you are designing.


USING GOLDBERG

Start by setting up your rails site, then install Goldberg into it:

    $ rails mysite
    $ cd mysite
    $ script/generate goldberg

Further details will then be displayed on how to complete the setup.


REQUIREMENTS

Goldberg depends on some other free software:

* MySQL version 5 or above (sorry, but Goldberg will *never* work on
  MySQL 4).  In future Goldberg will support other databases.

* Bluecloth: the Ruby implementation of Markdown, available from:
    http://www.deveiate.org/projects/BlueCloth

* Redcloth: the Ruby implementation of Textile, available from:
    http://whytheluckystiff.net/ruby/redcloth/


If you can't install Bluecloth and Redcloth on your system (e.g. if
you are using shared hosting) download them and copy the
"bluecloth.rb" and "redcloth.rb" files to the lib/ folder in your
Goldberg site.
