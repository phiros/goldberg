GOLDBERG

Goldberg is a generator that provides you with the files required to
set up a fully functional Rails web site.  The files include:

* Controller, model and view code and templates.

* A backup of a minimally-configured Goldberg database -- the
  "starter" database.

* A custom routing file.

Goldberg is designed to provide the framework around the web
application you are designing.
